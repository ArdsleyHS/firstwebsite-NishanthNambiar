  <h3>Overall parrots are good pets to have,I myself have a parrot,a red laren,and they are fun to play with and they need little to no maintenance,so the people who are stressed about the maintenance of the parrots dont worry parrots dont take as much maintanence as dogs and cats therefore its easier.All you have to do is feed it and take it a shower by spraying a water mist on them,thats all.So I suggest getting parrots as pets are one of the best options if you are looking into getting a pet.<h3>
